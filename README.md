# PIV_post_processing
This is a code package for analysing PIV data using principal component analysis or proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)  and kernal principal component analysis which includes preimaging 


# Software requirement 
Most of the code is running on Matlab and occasionally it can be python depending on the usasage 


## How to use this module
First you need to reformat the raw data using the data formating codes and with all the data rearranged you can then use the data anlysis code where main_PIV dimenional reduction include both POD/PCA and KPCA
